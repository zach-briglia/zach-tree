# Zach's tree viewer

## Description
A tree viewer made to demonstrate front/back end design, and UI/UX design. This app is deployed with Heroku with JawsDB on the backend.
JawsDB was opted over in place of CLEARDB due to some connection persistance and timeout issues. The production version of the app can be found at 
[this link.](https://pure-thicket-35698.herokuapp.com/) Most functionality has been met. SQL injections may still be an issue as I ran out of time before
being able to parameterize my queries.
